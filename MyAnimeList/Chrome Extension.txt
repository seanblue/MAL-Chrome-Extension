	b. Rank
	c. Popularity
	d. Number of Favorites
	e. Rating
	f. Start Date and End Date (how to compare year only or unknown dates?)

	i. Reverse sort.
4. Add a Chrome Extension icon which allows any of the above main features to be turned on/off. Also allow only selected fields to be shown in popover.

Might have to use background page (instead of just content script) to use chrome.tabs. This appears to be necessary for a page action.
