	b. Type (type) ['TV', 'Movie', etc.]
	c. Classification (classification) ['PG-13', etc. but with the description afterward]

	e. Title (quicker than scrolling; check alternate titles)
3. Sorting

4. Add a Chrome Extension icon which allows any of the above main features to be turned on/off. Also allow only selected fields to be shown in popover.
